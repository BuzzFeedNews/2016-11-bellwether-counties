# Counties That Predict The Election

This repository contains the data and analysis for the BuzzFeed News article, "[How Well Does Your County Predict The Next President?](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/how-well-does-your-county-predict-the-next-president)," published November 2, 2016.

## Data

The data needed for this notebook can be downloaded from the [CQPress Voting and Elections Collection](http://library.cqpress.com/elections/). Data licensing agreements prevent us from sharing this data with the repository. To run the analysis download the county-by-county voting results for every election since 1972 from CQPress and place it in the `cq-data` folder.

[`election_results.csv`](data/election_results.csv) contains the overall percentage of the vote that the two major parties received for each presidential election since 1972.
